### Dependancies 
run `pip install matplotlib` For live plotting and final graph.
run `pip install pytest` For running the test driver.

### How to run the program
run `main.py` after installing required dependancies either locally or in a virtual environment.
In `main.py` the user can enter different parameters to see different features.

### Testing
NOTE: The pytest_runner.py file when run with this non-visual project file setup will have two tests fail, as expected, since
the live plotting no longer exists.
